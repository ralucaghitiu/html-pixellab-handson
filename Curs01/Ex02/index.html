  <p>The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets,
    and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the
    web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative
    history of lorem ipsum.</p>

  <p>
    The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that
    doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text
    can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.</p>
